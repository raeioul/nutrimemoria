# Find the Pair

## ToDo

- [x] create a sandbox Square component with div that will rotate in x axis on click event - each side should have a different color
- [x] Square component should return to it's original position after a specified amount of time
- [x] images will return to initial position only if two are selected
- [x] and only two images may be activated at the same time
- [ ] create array containing information of reverse side of each Square
- [ ] randomise selection of obverse side for each Square item, and keep that information in an object (where key is, e.g., id, and value is image src)
- [ ] make it fully responsive
- [ ] move state to Redux store
- [ ] add persistence
