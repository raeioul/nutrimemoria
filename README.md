# Find the Pair

## ToDo

- [ ] create a sandbox Square component with div that will rotate in x axis on click event - each side should have a different color
- [ ] Square component should return to it's original position after specified amount of time (2s?)
- [ ] create array containing information of obverse side of each Square
- [ ] randomise selection of obverse side for each Square item, and keep that information in an object (where key is, e.g., id, and value is image src)
